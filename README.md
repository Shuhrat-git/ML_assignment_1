This project builds a neural network to predict wine quality using key machine learning techniques:

The input size represents the features used to make predictions.
The output size is a single value (the wine quality score).
The model processes the data and makes predictions.
The loss function measures how well predictions match actual values.
We train the model over multiple epochs to improve accuracy.
An optimizer adjusts weights using gradient descent.
The forward pass computes predictions, and the backward pass calculates gradients.
Finally, we use the trained model to predict wine quality scores.
